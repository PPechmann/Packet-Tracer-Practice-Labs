# ðŸŽ“ Cisco Packet Tracer Labs â€“ CCNA Practice

A collection of hands-on labs created in Cisco Packet Tracer to help students and aspiring network engineers practice and showcase CCNA-level networking skills.

Each lab focuses on real-world scenarios and core networking topics such as IPv4/IPv6 configuration, routing, switching, DHCP, ACLs, VLANs, and more.

You will find the challenge lab in the "labname-start" file and the solution in the "labname-solution" file.

To check the solution, check the running-configuration of the network devices or the configurations of the PCs and compare them to your configuration.

Have fun!
